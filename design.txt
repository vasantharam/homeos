User mode tasks:
=================
1. stub startup function, which is a call-gate jumper to
  user-mode entry point.
    (with paging, the entry point becomes standard, so gives
    a chiken egg situation).

    So as a trasit arrangement, let there be a copy of a stub-function
    per new task. 

2. Each new task creation, creates a call-gate for jump to entry point,
however after introduction of paging there can be just one.

3. The prototype of archCreateTask should change to take
a handle from memory manager representing the memory context of the
new task. (common entry point)

4. For now let kernel mode use 1x1 paging
